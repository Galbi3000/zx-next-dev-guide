	\textbf{Acknowlegements}

	A lot of work has gone into this book. But I also learned a lot. Not just about Z80 and Next, also \LaTeX~which basics I learned in secondary school and then all but forgotten. In this regard, I'd like to thank Jan Wilmans and Sean Young for creating the original Z80 Undocumented that I took as a basis for this book. I also need to thank countless kind folks on \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/}, those who asked questions and those who answered them; I found solutions to most issues I encountered there (and I was one very frequent visitor at times :) I'm very grateful to all members of {\tt z80-hardcore} Spectrum Next Discord channel who pointed out errors and shortcomings of the book. But especially Peter Ped Helcmanovsky who helped me fact-check the text and provided not only comments but also several pull requests. And last but not least, my family for being patient with my frequent long after-hours. Oh, also special shoutout to Bibi, our small JRT companion with the biggest heart :)
