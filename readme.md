# ZX Spectrum Next Developer Guide

Please see Introduction section of the LaTeX or PDF for information on the book, its history, original authors, printed copy etc!

# Editing

This is just as suggestion to help you if you're starting with LaTeX, not a prerequisite - feel free to use whichever editor and distribution you prefer!

I use VS Code with the following LaTeX plugins for editing:

- https://github.com/AREA44/vscode-LaTeX-support
- https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop.git

For compiling LaTeX, I use https://miktex.org/

# Sample code

Sample code from the book is also included in this repository. I use Visual Studio Code with DeZog plugin. If you wish to run them, you will need to download couple third party tools and copy them into empty subfolders inside `Tools`:

- sjasmplus 1.18.2: https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus
- CSpect 2.31.1: http://cspect.org/

# Todo / Ideas

Couple ideas for new content:

- Description for other relevant ZX Spectrum / Next port
- Sprites
- Tilemap (position between Layer 2 and Sprites)
- Addressing modes?
