# ZX Spectrum Next Developer Guide

Please see Introduction section of the LaTeX or PDF for information on the book, its history, original authors, printed copy etc!


# Editing

This is just as suggestion to help you if you're starting with LaTeX, not a prerequisite - feel free to use whichever editor and distribution you prefer!

I use VS Code with the following LaTeX plugins for editing:

- https://github.com/AREA44/vscode-LaTeX-support
- https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop.git

For compiling LaTeX, I use https://miktex.org/


# Todo / Ideas

Couple ideas for new content:

- Description for other relevant ZX Spectrum / Next port
- Code examples demonstrating port usage
- Example of bank switching in MMU mode
- Layer 2
- Sprites
- Addressing modes?
